# BogoSearch
Search Algorithm inspired by the infamous BogoSort

# Way it works

BogoSearch will randomly select 1 of the elements in the list passed to it -- if the selected element is not the element we are searching for it will randomly keep picking elements from the list until it finds the selected element.
